# Solid Mechanics Tools – Mohr Circle Analysis

Python scripts for **Advanced Solid Mechanics** coursework.  
Currently includes:
- **strain_with_mohr.py** → Analyze a small-strain tensor (principal strains, invariants, Mohr’s circles, reports, plots).  
- **stress_with_mohr.py** → Analyze a stress tensor (principal stresses, invariants, Mohr’s circles, reports, plots).  

Future scripts will be added when they are added.
